*coming soon*

### kbvis.py
A customiseable audio visualiser that monitors audio output, calculates bass amplitude and then uses the keyboard backlight to let you experience your music on a whole new level.

### pulse.sh
A nice smooth script that makes the keyboard backlight pulse on each keypress.

### dance.sh
A script to make all available leds (excluding display backlight) change to a random unique brightness setting on each keypress.

### spaz.sh
Literally the name. Sets all backlights (excluding display backlight) to a random value repetitively for 5 seconds.

### autobacklight.sh
Automatically triggers the keyboard and touchpad backlight to fade in on keypresses, will fade out after a very short time with no keypresses. This delay is configurable.
